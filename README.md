# Chicago_Crime

We were three people working on this project with some overlap in tasks. 
Lars were responsible for the general analysis of trending crimes and areas.
Sebastian were responsible for plotting heatmaps and predictions based on Lars findings.
Janna were responsible of deeper analysis of specific crimes' locations and descriptions.
