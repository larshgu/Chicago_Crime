# Chicago_Crime

## Introduction
This project used findings from the Kaggle Chicago Crime dataset to recommend actions towards a predictive policing strategy for the Chicago Police Department.
The main findings where a large increase in narcotics of 180% in Humboldt Park in the last two years.
The three notebooks attached are the notebooks of three different teammembers with different responsibilities.

## Explore notebooks
All notebooks can be run independently of each other and the code is commented to make it easy to follow.
crime-forecasting-main-lars.ipynb should be explored for general visualizations and insights while chicago-crime-forecast.ipynb and chicago-crime-heatmaps.ipynb are more detailed.

## Running the code
The notebooks should be run at https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks/welcome as this is where we extract out data.
